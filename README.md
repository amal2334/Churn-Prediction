# Churn Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting customer churnâ€”whether a customer will stay with the company or leave. The goal is to build a model that helps businesses understand which customers are at risk of leaving so they can take action in advance.

Objective
To study a classification problem using churn prediction and apply different machine learning algorithms to find the best model.

Steps I Followed
1. Load the Dataset
I started by loading the dataset into my project.

2. Understand the Dataset
I explored the dataset using statistical methods to understand the data types, distributions, and overall structure.

3. Preprocess the Data
I cleaned the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the data for modeling.

4. Visualize the Data
I created plots and charts to explore patterns, trends, and relationships between features and churn.

5. Data Encoding
I converted categorical features into numeric formats so that machine learning models could work with the data.

6. Correlation Analysis
I analyzed the correlations between different features to identify key factors related to churn.

Model Selection
I implemented and compared four different machine learning algorithms for churn prediction:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost Classifier

Model Evaluation
I evaluated the models using appropriate metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

This helped me compare the models and select the one that performed best for this dataset.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Matplotlib, Seaborn
